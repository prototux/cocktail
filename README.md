This is my personal color scheme i use in various things, including my terminal and my desktop theme.

It was designed to be bright (but not flashy!) on dark gray backgrounds.

As it was mainly designed for my terminal, which i use all the time, it was also designed to not induce eye strain after several hours. 

For now only the 8 primary colors (for terminal, with bright versions) are designed, but i plan to extend it to be able to use it for code highlighting.

Inspirations for this color scheme were mainly molokai and breeze dark.
