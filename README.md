This is my personal color scheme and syntax highlighting config i use in various things, including my terminal and my desktop theme.

It was designed to be bright (but not flashy!) on dark gray backgrounds.

It is not (yet) considered stable, so there will probably be changes in the colors.

As it was mainly designed for my terminal, which i use all the time, it was also designed to not induce eye strain after several hours.

Inspirations for this color scheme were mainly molokai and breeze dark.
